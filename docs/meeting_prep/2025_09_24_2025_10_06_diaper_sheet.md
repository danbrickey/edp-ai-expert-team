# Diaper Sheet: Two Week Summary (Sep 24 - Oct 6, 2025)

## My Action Items Progress

### ✓ Completed
- Successfully transitioned dbt to Franken environment (renamed to North Star Dev)
- Resolved GitHub authentication issues with dbt support
- Fixed dbt cross-project reference issue (manifest update required after environment changes)
- Implemented dev_raw_clone_db separation for data engineering vs ingestion teams
- Presented and received approval for MSK to S3 CSV proposal at Architecture Review Board
- Delivered director summary to Ram (based on PI planning week content)
- Set up zero-copy clone strategy for parallel development environments
- Completed documentation for EDP platform audit (Lindsay's request)
- Created C4 diagramming approach combining domain-driven design for multi-level audiences

### 🔄 In Progress
- **EDP roadmap refinement with HCE department** - tracking dependencies in addition to priorities
  - HCE will track table dependencies during daily/weekly/monthly business processes
  - Need follow-up sessions to incorporate all comments
- **Repository splitting** - preparing to split EDP Data Domains into:
  - EDP Streaming (for real-time use cases)
  - EDP Data Integrations (for OneView and similar)
  - EDP Data Domains (for analytical platform transformations)
- **OneView real-time data via deferred merge views** - CSV-based approach
  - Working with Ranga (Snowflake consultant) on implementation
  - Enables near real-time data without frequent batch loads
- **Documentation for Abacus engagement** - brain dumps needed on:
  - cl03 and cl04
  - dbar (audit data requirements)
  - sbad audit
  - Source tables organized by BCI business domain
  - Pharmacy, pharmacy claims, and prescriber assignment
- **Data modeling workflow automation** - working on design-to-code generation
  - Goal: Go from data model artifacts to generated dbt code in one agentic step
- **Provider 360 naming refinement** - "Provider Engagement" fact name conflicts with department name
- **Agentic workflow for slide deck generation** - new capability exploration

### 📋 Pending / Next Steps
- **Repository splitting execution** - coordinate with OneView team for their new pipelines
- **Data modeling for Q1** - focus on dimensional models and documentation
- **Contract documentation PoC prep** (One View benefit summary):
  - Get frequently-asked-questions list from customer service (Jesse volunteering)
  - Work with data governance to sanitize contract documents (remove PHI)
  - Set up Snowflake stage for PDF/image ingestion
  - Test Cortex AI (Arctic model) for document summarization
  - Schedule follow-up meeting in 2 weeks
- **HCE use case solutions**:
  - Reference data upload capability (possibly Streamlit app)
  - ML model output persistence (feedback loop to raw layer with approval process)
  - Analytical capabilities (replacing on-prem EDW 2D models)

## Tasks That Should Be Delegated

- **Repository configuration and splitting** (DevOps/Admin skills: Ian, Mike, or Emily)
  - Current: 2 repos (EDP_source_data, EDP_Data_Domains)
  - Future: 4 repos (add EDP_Streaming, EDP_Data_Integrations)
- **Dev environment testing and validation** (Data Engineering: Jason, Shreya, Cameron, Brian)
  - Validate dev_raw_clone_db works for all teams
  - Test dbt projects in new environment configurations
- **Zero-copy clone creation and management** (Snowflake Admin: Ian, Mike)
  - dev_raw_clone_db for data engineering teams
  - Refresh schedule determination
- **OneView deferred merge view implementation** (Data Engineering + Snowflake: Team collaboration)
  - CSV ingestion pipeline
  - View layer combining batch + stream data
- **Contract document PoC infrastructure** (Data Engineering: Jason, Shreya)
  - Snowflake stage setup
  - Cortex AI permissions and testing
  - Initial summarization testing
- **Provider Data Council metrics refinement** (Data Governance: Nicole, Tina)
  - Metric definitions aligned with business pain points
  - Naming conventions that avoid department name conflicts

## My Follow-Up Required

- **Abacus architecture alignment** - confirmed with Sani that Abacus bronze/silver flows into our raw layer (not directly to curation)
  - Maintains Data Vault 2.0 methodology integrity
  - Allows us to control integration, security (tenant ID), and generation through AI
- **EDP roadmap sessions** - continue working with Lindsay, HCE team (Dave Algren, Rhett Barton, Cassie Morton)
  - Incorporate dependency tracking into prioritization
  - Classify data sources (official systems vs one-off extracts)
- **Provider Data Council modeling** - work with Nicole and Tina on revised approach
  - Business-friendly diagramming at higher levels
  - Engineering detail at lower levels
  - Alternative fact naming for "Provider Engagement"
- **Data engineers environment validation** - Jason, Shreya testing homework completion
- **Jesse's FAQ collection** - for contract summarization PoC

## I Am Blocked By:

- **HCE table dependency tracking** - waiting for ~1 month of business process logging before we have complete requirements
- **Customer service FAQ list** - Jesse collecting; needed for contract PoC scope definition
- **Franken to Dev environment rename** - was expected Sep 25/26, status unclear
- **Legacy Facets sunset decision** - business timeline unclear (target: end of year)

## I Am Blocking:

- **OneView team pipeline setup** - waiting for repository split completion before they can proceed with real-time ingestion
- **Data engineering teams' full dev capabilities** - dev_raw_clone_db switch in progress, minor testing issues resolved
- **Provider Data Council** - waiting on revised fact naming and metric definitions before they can proceed
- **Abacus detailed discovery** - need to complete documentation brain dumps to enable smoother technical discussions

## Key Decisions Made (Past 2 Weeks)

- **Dev environment architecture**: Separate raw databases for ingestion dev (dev_raw_db) vs data engineering dev (dev_raw_clone_db)
- **Repository strategy**: Split from 2 to 4 repos to enable independent release schedules per use case type
- **Abacus integration approach**: Their bronze/silver feeds our raw layer (not our curation layer) to maintain Data Vault 2.0 methodology
- **OneView real-time data**: Use deferred merge views with CSV files to achieve near real-time without frequent batch loads
- **HCE cloud use cases**: Different solutions than on-prem (Streamlit for reference data, approval process for ML output persistence)
- **Contractor usage philosophy** (from IT Town Hall): Use contractors for run/maintain, internal staff for design/build

## Strategic Context

### IT Reorganization (from Town Hall)
New reporting structure to CIO David Yu:
1. Business Relationship Management
2. Office of the CIO
3. Cybersecurity and GRC
4. Infrastructure
5. EA and Enterprise Common Services
6. AI and Innovation
7. Data (Governance, Strategy, Platform, Support)

Target shift: from 30% design/build + 70% maintain → 70% design/build + 30% maintain

### Abacus Engagement Timeline
- Started: Oct 1, 2025
- Duration: Through end of summer 2026 (plus testing/deployment)
- Scope: CMS-9115, CMS-0057 (interoperability/API), source data ingestion, foundational data marts

### Ram's Guidance
Delegate tangible work, spread guidance across teams, reserve time for business alignment this quarter.
