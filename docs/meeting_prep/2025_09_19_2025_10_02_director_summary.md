# Director Summary: September 19 - October 2, 2025

## Executive Summary

Successfully recovered from repository deletion incident and advanced NorthStar platform consolidation through strategic Franken environment transition. Established foundational business alignment through Provider Data Council and initiated critical partnerships with Abacus for CMS compliance. Made key architectural decisions on ingestion strategy, near real-time capabilities, and AI innovation roadmap while managing cost optimization concerns.

---

## Key Decisions Made

### **Decision**: Two-Phase NorthStar Consolidation via Franken Environment
- **Rationale**: Minimize disruption to data engineering teams; allow RBAC/PBAC cleanup without impacting development velocity; front-load transition early in PI to protect delivery schedules
- **Impact**: Development teams transition in first 2 weeks of PI 3.2; Rising Sun repurposed for POC/training only; single NorthStar account by end of PI

### **Decision**: Dual Raw Layer Strategy for Dev Environment
- **Rationale**: Ingestion development requires stable raw layer; data engineering needs fresh production clones for accurate testing
- **Impact**: Created dev_raw_db (ingestion team) and dev_raw_clone_db (engineering team) to prevent clashes; enables parallel workflows

### **Decision**: Split DBT Repositories by Release Cadence
- **Rationale**: OneView near real-time requirements conflict with 4-6 hour analytical batch cycles; need independent orchestration
- **Impact**: Proposed EDP_Streaming, EDP_Data_Integrations, EDP_Data_Domains repos; enables <5 minute latency for OneView

### **Decision**: CSV in S3 as Primary Ingestion (Retire MSK/Kafka)
- **Rationale**: Significant cost reduction; simplified architecture; sufficient performance for near real-time with partitioning
- **Impact**: ARB approved Sept 30; full migration plan in progress; cost savings substantial

### **Decision**: Maintain Raw Layer Control for Abacus Integration
- **Rationale**: Preserve Data Vault 2.0 methodology; maintain security controls (tenant ID); enable AI-powered business rule migration
- **Impact**: Abacus Bronze/Silver flows into our Raw layer (not direct Silver consumption); architectural consistency maintained

### **Decision**: Deferred Merge View Pattern for Near Real-Time
- **Rationale**: Leverages existing Kafka pattern work; lowest implementation risk; proven approach
- **Impact**: UNION ALL view combines ingested + streaming data; dynamic tables apply business rules; <5 min latency achievable

## Accomplishments

### **Achievement**: Repository Recovery from PHI Scan Deletion (Sept 19)
- **Business Value**: Restored develop branch from backup; reconfigured branch protection; all environments operational; minimal data loss
- **Next Steps**: Complete remaining branch protection rules; finalize NorthStar migration to prevent similar disruptions

### **Achievement**: DBT NorthStar Franken Transition Initiated
- **Business Value**: First phase of platform consolidation underway; EDP_Source_Data project testing complete
- **Next Steps**: Resolve GitHub authentication issues with Sean Trent; complete EDP_Data_Domains transition; rename Franken to Dev mid-week

### **Achievement**: Provider Data Council Operational
- **Business Value**: First business domain council driving data product development; pattern established for Membership and Product councils
- **Next Steps**: Refine data model naming (provider engagement fact); launch Membership & Product councils in October

### **Achievement**: Abacus Partnership Kicked Off (Sept 24)
- **Business Value**: CMS-9115 & CMS-0057 compliance; prior auth & FHIR interoperability; source data ingestion through summer 2026
- **Next Steps**: Continue discovery sessions for BCI domains (claims, pharmacy, membership); architectural alignment with Sani

### **Achievement**: OneView AI POC Designed
- **Business Value**: Q1 2026 execution for contract benefit summarization; establishes pattern for unstructured data analytics
- **Next Steps**: Collect customer service FAQ list (Jesse); prepare test documents with data governance; schedule bi-weekly design sessions

### **Achievement**: HCE Analytics Roadmap Alignment
- **Business Value**: Clarified prioritization and use cases; business will track table dependencies over next month to inform roadmap
- **Next Steps**: Refine roadmap based on dependencies; address three use cases (reference data, ML output persistence, analytics)

### **Achievement**: ARB Approval for CSV Ingestion Strategy
- **Business Value**: Architectural decision validated; cost optimization path cleared; simplified stack approved
- **Next Steps**: Execute migration plan; retire MSK/Kafka on approved timeline

## Escalation Items

### **Issue**: Repository Deleted by PHI Scan (Sept 19)
- **Impact**: Lost all merge history, branch history; only develop branch restored; would be production-down event in true prod environment
- **Recommendation**: Completed recovery; documented procedures; accelerate NorthStar migration to reduce risk exposure

### **Issue**: GitHub Authentication Failing in NorthStar
- **Impact**: Blocking DBT EDP_Data_Domains transition; data engineers cannot test in Franken environment
- **Recommendation**: Escalated to Sean Trent and team; DBT support ticket opened; resolution expected Oct 3

### **Issue**: AI Code Migration POC Not Production-Ready (Sept 23)
- **Impact**: 200K lines of on-prem code produced plausible but unusable output; scope too broad for context window
- **Recommendation**: Ram/David approved hybrid approach - migrate one domain at a time with AI refactoring; focus on related business entities

### **Issue**: Snowflake Cortex AI Cost Spike
- **Impact**: Alarming increase in Rising Sun AI compute; current POC approaches may be cost-prohibitive at scale
- **Recommendation**: Engage Snowflake AI expert through Ranga; establish realistic cost baselines before scaling POCs

### **Issue**: Franken DBT Cross-Project Reference Bug (Oct 2)
- **Impact**: Staging environment references outdated; blocked OneView testing
- **Recommendation**: Resolved - needed updated job manifest in upstream project; documented requirement for future environment changes

### **Issue**: Architecture Decisions During PI Planning
- **Impact**: Multiple key decisions made during planning week limited team velocity
- **Recommendation**: Establish architectural runway cadence to front-load decisions before PI planning weeks
