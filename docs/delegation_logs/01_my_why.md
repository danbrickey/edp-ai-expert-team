WHY I'M DELEGATING:

Short-term (this month):
- To have bandwidth for actual architecture work
- To stop drowning in everyone else's tasks
- To reduce stress and prevent burnout

Medium-term (this quarter):
- To develop competency in my team
- To create better standards and practices in my department
- To spend 50%+ of time on strategic architecture work

Long-term (this year):
- To build an island of competency in my department
- To be the architect who builds capability, not just systems
- To prove that good work is possible even in organizational dysfunction
- To have a sustainable, fulfilling role doing work I actually love

SPECIFIC ARCHITECTURE WORK I WANT TIME FOR:
1. AI Code refactoring (POC done - make it an embedded process)
2. AI Unstructured data summarization POC
3. AI ready documentation on the EDP platform so that we are ready for AI code assistants when they are approved

WHEN I HESITATE TO DELEGATE:
Read this list. Remember what I'm building toward.
The discomfort is worth it for this vision.
