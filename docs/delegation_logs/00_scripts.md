This is a log of tasks that I am delegating and how the delegation process went inside my head so that I can get used to this new activity I need to do at work that I'm uncomfortable with. Also has the utility of helping me track the delegation if I need to follow up on it, which I will probably keep tracking even after I am comfortable with the delegation part.

## **DATE DELEGATED**: [date]
- **TASK**: [description]
- **DELEGATE**: [name/team]
- **FOLLOW-UP**: [date]
- **NOTES**: [detailed_task_notes]
- **REFLECTION**:
  - **Fear**: [fear_identification]
  - **Outcome**: [actual_result] 
  - **Insights** [anxiety_insights]


## When You SHOULD Inform (Not Ask Permission)
- Send an FYI after you've delegated:
  - Might affect team velocity or sprint commitments
  - Involves cross-team coordination
  - Program manager needs visibility for planning
- Someone else might be tracking that work
- Format: "FYI, I assigned [X] to [team/person]. Should be done by [date]. Let me know if this creates any conflicts."
- Notice: You're telling them what you did, not asking if you can do it.

## When You Actually Need Approval/Alignment
- Check before delegating:
  - Significantly changes priorities or commitments
  - Has budget/resourcing implications
  - Affects external commitments or deadlines
  - Crosses organizational boundaries in unclear ways
  - You're genuinely unsure if it's your call

- For the gitlab task: You don't need approval or even an FYI. Asking gitlab admins to configure gitlab is like asking a chef to cook. It's their job.

# Being direct

## Level 1: Still gentle but clearer:
"Hey Carl, this bug is in a system your team owns. Can you have Brad or someone take a look? Let me know if there's a reason your team can't handle it and we'll figure out alternatives."
## Level 2: More direct:
"Hey Carl, assigning this bug to your team since it's in your system. Have Brad or someone dig into it. Shout if you need anything."
## Level 3: Very direct (appropriate for clear ownership):
"Carl - this is in your team's system, having your team fix it. Brad's probably the right person. Loop me in if you need architectural input."

# Scripts for Future Delegations

## For clarifying what someone wants from you:
"Just to clarify - are you asking me to [do the work] or [provide direction]?"

## For straightforward delegation:
"Hey [name], I need you to handle [task]. It's in [your area/system]. Due by [date]. Let me know what you need."

## For delegation with support offer:
"[Name], assigning [task] to you since it's [reason]. I'm available if you need [specific support]. Due [date]."

## For delegation to someone senior/peer:
"Hey [name], this [task] is in your area. Can you or your team take this on? Happy to provide context."
