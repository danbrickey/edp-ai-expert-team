# Executive Summary: Week of October 21-28, 2025

## 🟢 Strategic Progress (On Track)
- **Abacus Partnership**: Data source discovery completed; ready for implementation
- **Provider Roadmap**: Q1-Q4 2026 use cases prioritized with business stakeholders
- **AI Governance**: Approved for Snowflake Cortex POC on contract PDF analysis
- **Boomi Procurement**: Vendor agreements in progress; training scheduled upon completion

## 🟡 Attention Needed (Medium Risk)
- **Rising Sun Deprecation**: One environment dependency remains for 2 weeks (testing)
- **Security Review**: Timeline pending from security team for Snowflake role review
- **Streaming Repo**: Refactor delayed until November 4th due to delivery pressure

## 🔴 Escalation Items
- **Persistent Data Storage**: Architecture needs resolution for analyst data persistence without security compromise

## Detailed Weekly Summary

### Key Strategic Accomplishments

**🎯 Abacus Data Partnership - Phase Complete**
- Completed comprehensive data source discovery covering eligibility, claims, and provider data
- Defined ingestion formats and timelines for all data sources
- Identified remaining subject matter expert sessions needed for specific use cases
- **Business Value**: Positions EDP as primary data platform for external partnership integrations
- **Next Steps**: Schedule breakout sessions with SMEs; obtain meeting transcripts for detailed documentation

**📋 Provider Services Roadmap Alignment**
- Deep dive sessions completed with provider leadership team (Part 2 of series)
- All use cases mapped to quarterly targets (Q1-Q4 2026) with dependencies identified
- Captured critical new requirement: Network adequacy reporting by zip code/specialty
- **Business Value**: Clear 12-month execution plan for $X million provider services initiative
- **Next Steps**: Incorporate network adequacy metrics into provider fact table design

**🤖 AI Governance Approval Secured**
- AI Governance Council approved Snowflake Cortex usage for POC
- Use case: Contract PDF analysis to summarize benefits for customer service agents
- **Business Value**: Enables automated contract intelligence, reducing manual review time
- **Next Steps**: Set up Cortex in Rising Sun sandbox; begin POC development

### Critical Decisions Made

**Decision**: Implement tenant ID-based row access policies instead of complex lookup tables
- **Rationale**: Reduces query compute overhead; simplifies security model; Data Governance will manage tenant ID assignments
- **Impact**: Performance improvement on all secured queries; cleaner architecture going forward
- **Owner**: Tina (Data Governance) and Dan (Architecture)

**Decision**: Separate streaming and batch data pipeline repositories
- **Rationale**: Different architectures, deployment processes, and requirements warrant separate code management
- **Impact**: Cleaner code organization; reduced confusion; delayed until November 4th
- **Owner**: Dan (Architecture), Jason and Shreya (implementation)

**Decision**: Provider analysts get temporary table upload capability with auto-cleanup
- **Rationale**: Balances analyst flexibility with security and data governance requirements
- **Impact**: Enables side-loading use cases; requires DBA automation for 2-week cleanup process
- **Owner**: DBA team for cleanup automation

### Team Capacity and Resource Utilization

- **Martin Rivera**: Last week before departure; PCP attribution refactor completion in progress
- **Lakshmi's Team**: Transitioning to dbt; requires 1-hour training session scheduled this week
- **Leonardo's Team**: Refresher dbt training in progress; team re-onboarded to developer access after 1-year hiatus
- **Team 1**: Sprint planning focused on Rising Sun sandbox configuration (databases, roles)
- **Contractor Support**: Jason/Shreya on streaming refactor (November 4th target)

### Stakeholder Engagement Summary

**External Partners**:
- BCBSA: Exploring Snowflake data sharing for Blue Provider Directory (BPD) analytical use cases
- Boomi: Initial product demonstration completed; confirmed not suitable for complex data transformations

**Internal Stakeholders**:
- Provider Services (Joe Sheer, Lindsey Smith): Network adequacy requirements captured; Snowflake interface training provided
- Data Governance (Tina, Nicole): Process alignment established for requirements gathering → business rules → code
- Security Team (Luke Bechtel, Nick Rudy): Pending timeline for role/permission security review

### Risk Identification and Mitigation

**🔴 HIGH - Persistent Data Storage Architecture**
- **Issue**: No approved solution for analysts to persist analysis results without security policy bypass risk
- **Impact**: Blocks provider team use cases that require intermediate data persistence
- **Recommendation**: Escalate to architecture review board; propose governed schema with audit trail

**🟡 MEDIUM - Rising Sun Environment Dependencies**
- **Issue**: Dev environment must remain operational for 2 weeks during deprecation
- **Impact**: Delays full sandbox conversion
- **Mitigation**: Clear cutover date; NS_data_gov_DB preserved during testing window

**🟡 MEDIUM - Security Review Timeline Uncertainty**
- **Issue**: No committed timeline from security team for Snowflake role review
- **Impact**: Potential delays to production promotion
- **Recommendation**: Follow up with Luke/Nick for commitment by end of week

### Cross-Team Dependencies

- **Data Governance → Architecture**: Tenant ID column flagging must precede row access policy implementation
- **DBA Team → Provider Services**: Auto-cleanup process for temporary tables required before analyst onboarding
- **Architecture → Streaming Team**: Repository split depends on November 4th delivery completion
- **Architecture → Lakshmi's Team**: dbt migration training and initial model development support

### Budget and Vendor Relationships

- **Boomi Procurement**: Awaiting final contract signatures; training budget allocated
- **GitHub Copilot**: Confirmed for Q1 2026 rollout (architecture discussion outcome)
- **Abacus Partnership**: Data infrastructure investment supporting external revenue opportunity
