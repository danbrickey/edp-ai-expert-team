# delegation
Made a list of tasks that I have on my plate that should actually be delegated to someone else. Created a delegation log in the docs folder. Started delegation log for October. I'm gonna put that into my meeting or note summarizer query so that I can have delegation tasks and follow up pop up on my status reports. I delegated the repo branch protections to Sean Trent, and delegated fixing the member consecutive coverage model issues to the data extracts team, probably Brad, or Amith. I left that up to Carl. Not that good at delegating, but I'm trying to get better. I'm taking notes on how delegation makes me feel and what the actual outcomes are to try to get over some of my anxiety with assigning things to other people.
